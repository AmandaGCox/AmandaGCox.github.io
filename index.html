<p>Welcome! My name is Amanda Grace!</p>
<img src="CpS105OfficialPic">
<p>I am a sophomore in college, studying accounting at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing the piano, cooking, and crunching the numbers...</p>
<p>I have two older sisters, two younger sisters, and five younger brothers. My youngest brother has Down's Syndrome and, if I had not chosen to study accounting, I would have majored in special education. My favorite outreach has been volunteering at special needs events in the Greenville community. The Greenville Parks and Recreation department hosts a semiannual Special Olympics event. I had the opportunity to volunteer at this event in the fall of 2016 and I would recommend this opportunity to anyone looking to brighten someone else's day!</p>

<p>I am also currently training to run a half-marathon. The training process has been challenging yet fun and I would recommend the following website to anyone interested in getting in shape and simultaneously checking that 13.1 off their bucket list!</p>
